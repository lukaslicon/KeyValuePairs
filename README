In this assignment I have created a Dictionary ADT in C++ that maintains a set of pairs whose members are called key and value.

This program writes two string representations of the Dictionary to the output file. The first string consists of pairs of the form "key : value\n"
so that when printed, each pair appears on its own line. The keys are in alphabetical order. The second representation consists of keys only, 
one to a line, with the order obtained from a pre-order tree walk.

Program USAGE
#USAGE: ./Order <input file><output file>

--Order.cpp--
this is the main program for this project
this program takes 2 arguments, input file for reading and output file for writing.
this file implements all functions written out for use in Dictionary.cpp.
Order.cpp reads in the lines of an input file, each line being a (unique) single string, then insert these strings (as keys) into a Dictionary.

--Dictionary.cpp--
Implementation of functions used in Order.cpp for performing operations.
this file contains all the implementation of the function delcarations defined in Dictionary.h

--Dictionary.h--
this is a header file that contains all the function declarations for Dictionary.cpp
the compiler uses the information in the header files to declare what functions and structures are available to the programmer and how to use them.

--DictionaryTest.cpp--
this file is to be used as a test client. I created my own tests to test all Dictionary functions involved in Dictionary.h
this file outputs to terminal every other file that outputs, outputs to the output file.

--Makefile--
the Makefile contains a list of rules that tells the system what commands need/want to be executed.
the Makefile is created so that a program can compile due to the executables.

--README--
table of contents that explains what each file contains.
